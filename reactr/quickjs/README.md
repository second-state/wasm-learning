# Reactr getting started

[Reactr](https://github.com/suborbital/reactr) is a fast, performant function scheduling library. Reactr is designed to be flexible, with the ability to run embedded in your Go applications and first-class support for WebAssembly.

Reactr runs functions called Runnables, and transparently spawns workers to process jobs. Each worker processes jobs in sequence, using Runnables to execute them. Reactr jobs are arbitrary data, and they return arbitrary data (or an error). Jobs are scheduled, and their results can be retrieved at a later time.

Reactr has support for Wasm-packaged Runnables. The rwasm package contains a multi-tenant Wasm scheduler, an API to grant capabilities to Wasm Runnables, and support for several languages including Rust (stable), TypeScript/AssemblyScript (beta), and Swift (alpha).

To use Reactr with WasmEdge, you need to pass `-tags wasmedge` to the go command.
